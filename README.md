## Usage

## Introduction:
This Repository has been created to lay the building foundation for my career as a programmer. The last four years have prooven me that the world of system engineering doesnt fit my desire for learning new things each and every day. Thus I am starting this repository to get to learn the basics of Java and JavaScript to later on use during my studies.
